**here we operate from two ends one from the job provider and one from the job seeker end.**

# step0:

## Company 'A' prepare it's profile to hire candidates

- firstly it will set it's job status true so that our job search engine can search it's job's and make it available on job's dashboard
- secondly the Company will describe it's job requirement
- describe it in the field of following field
- programming language
- programming design pattern
- experience with frameworks and tools

# step1:

- user with matching profile will only view the job and they can apply for it
- they have to link their source code project hosted on servers like (github, bitbucket, gitlab etc)
- they can apply for the job along with answering the questions which the company gave.

# step2:

## job provider (give's the job)

**if Company 'A' want to hire developer's with javascript developer's profile then the candidate must fullfill following criteria:**

- he should be experienced with javascript
- he must have hosted his dummy work somewhere ex(github, bitbucket, gitlab etc)
- he must have knowledge of tools used in javascript community (ex: eslint, flow, typescript, ES6 ect)
  **so if we can somehow give all these information's along with user's CV to Company 'A' it will save time of company 'A' and by visually**
  - it can analyse the user profile and if the company is interested in having a deep look into his profile. we can also give them that access.

# step3:

**Company 'A' selected few candidates and now they want to hire the best**

- we can provide them group video call for interview \* we can provide realtime coding environment for coding along with score and ranking
